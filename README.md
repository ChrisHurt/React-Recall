This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Memorisation App

> A react app for remembering people's names with a custom UI

## Demo of Application
- This is currently under construction and a link will be placed here when ready.

## Initial Scope and Planning
### Sprint 1
- 1. The first UI concept for representing the data is multiples circles packed within a larger circle
  - See: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CirclePacking.html
  - People will be represented by the smaller circles with photo thumbnails and with names initially hidden
  - After clicking the circle should expand and push the adjacent circles away, avoiding overlap
  - As the user clicks on a person the name will be revealed and they can indicate if they remembered correctly
    - This could be done automatically by typing their name in an input prior to clicking or,
    - This could be done by using a check box in the circle
### Sprint 2
- 2. Look into methods for collecting data to integrate into the UI for testing
  - Consider:
    - Facebook API
    - LinkedIn API
    - Any other API's or accessible data that can be applied in this context
  - Look into methods for allowing user input and storage of this data as appropriate and if needed
  - Custom memorisation fields, instead of thumbnails & names for people
      - Photo & Job title for people or,
      - Plant photos and names (maybe you figure out which obscure little brown mushrooms are which!) [https://www.mushroom-appreciation.com/little-brown-mushrooms.html]
